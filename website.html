   <h4>HTML</h4>
<p>HTML<strong>(HyperText Markup Language) </strong>is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It uses tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.</P>
<h4>History of html</h4>
<P>Here’s a concise overview of the key milestones in the history of HTML</p>
<strong>📜 Origins & Early Years (1989–1994)</strong><br>
<strong>1989–1991:</strong> Tim Berners‑Lee at CERN invents the World Wide Web. He designs HTML based on SGML and releases the first browser/editor, WorldWideWeb (later Nexus), on a NeXT computer. The initial version contained only about 18 tags like  (title), (a), (img), (p)<br> 
<p><strong>1993: </strong>The Mosaic browser introduces inline images, propelling widespread adoption and prompting informal feature additions by browser developers</p>
<strong>🚀 Formalization & Expansion (1995–1999)</strong><br>
<p><strong>1995:</strong> HTML 2.0 becomes the first official IETF standard, adding support for forms and tables</p>
<p><strong>1998–1999:</strong> HTML 4.0/4.01 standardizes CSS integration, internationalization, scripting, and accessibility via features like the alt attribute</p>
<p><strong>📘 XHTML Interregnum (2000–2006)</strong><br>
2000: W3C introduces XHTML 1.0—a stricter, XML-based reformulation of HTML 4.01. It offers better structure but proves overly rigid for many developers</p>
<p><strong>🌐 HTML5 & the Living Standard (2004–Present)</strong><br>
<p><strong>2004:</strong> WHATWG forms (Mozilla, Opera, Apple) to push HTML forward, focusing on multimedia, semantic markup, and APIs </p>
<p><strong>2008–2014: </strong>The HTML5 draft is adopted by W3C in 2007 and becomes a formal Recommendation on October 28, 2014</p>
<p><strong>2016–2021:</strong> HTML5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 are released, and by 2019, WHATWG becomes sole maintainer under the "HTML Living Standard" model 
<h4>🔧 Evolution Highlights</h4>
<p><strong>Backward compatibility:</strong> HTML was built with “forwards support” in mind—older pages still work in new browsers </p>
<p><strong>New features over time:</strong>( video, audio, canvas, )semantic tags (header, nav, article), rich APIs, responsive images, and accessibility enhancements</p>
